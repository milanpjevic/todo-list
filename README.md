Hello!

This is my first JavaScript project.

The idea was to understand how to use the localStorage on the browser, 
to play with the simple JS, to use some methods... and just to start familiarized myself with the syntax.

Multiple filter choice is not the feature that is included in the project, 
but it is something that I might work on.

I would be happy to implement any suggestions that you might have to make this project more valuable, 
and generally to upgrade my coding approach. 

Thank you for your time. 

Do you have something TO DO? :)
